                    Our public library is a credit to the communities that we serve
                    and anyone who likes to read and learn should be a member.
                    Parents who homeschool should be especially adamant about getting their children used
                    to library from the time that the children are young. Making the library a part of
                    childhood makes it's more likely that people will continue to use the library even once they are adults.
